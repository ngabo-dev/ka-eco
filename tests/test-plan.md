# Ka-Eco Wetland Management System - Comprehensive Testing Plan

## Testing Overview
This document outlines comprehensive tests for the Ka-Eco Wetland Management System, focusing on user roles, permissions, authentication, and workflows.

## Test Categories

### 1. User Accounts & Authentication

#### 1.1 Account Creation Tests
- [x] **RegisterForm excludes admin role**: Only shows "Researcher", "Government Official", "Community Member"
- [ ] **Admin account creation prevention**: Verify admin accounts cannot be created via public signup
- [ ] **Registration validation**: Test email format, password strength, required fields
- [ ] **Duplicate prevention**: Test username/email uniqueness validation

#### 1.2 Login & Access Control Tests
- [ ] **Role-based login**: Test login for all roles (admin, researcher, government_official, community_member)
- [ ] **Credential validation**: Test incorrect username/password rejection
- [ ] **Account status check**: Test login with inactive accounts
- [ ] **Session management**: Test session timeout and activity tracking
- [ ] **Role-based dashboard access**: Verify users see appropriate dashboard based on role

#### 1.3 Admin User Management Tests
- [ ] **User list access**: Admin can view all registered users
- [ ] **User approval workflow**: Test user approval/rejection (if implemented)
- [ ] **Credential management**: Admin can update user credentials
- [ ] **User deletion**: Admin can delete users with proper confirmation
- [ ] **Permission enforcement**: Non-admin users cannot access user management

### 2. Wetland Management (Core System)

#### 2.1 Admin Privileges Tests
- [ ] **CRUD permissions**: Only admin can add/edit/delete wetland records
- [ ] **Wetland attributes**: Verify all required fields (name, location, size, biodiversity, status)
- [ ] **Action logging**: Verify wetland operations are logged for accountability
- [ ] **Data integrity**: Test wetland data validation and constraints

#### 2.2 User Observations Tests
- [ ] **Observation submission**: Non-admin users can submit field observations
- [ ] **Observation attributes**: Test water quality data, wildlife sightings, pollution incidents
- [ ] **Admin review**: Submitted observations appear in admin dashboard
- [ ] **User attribution**: Observations are timestamped and linked to submitter
- [ ] **Permission verification**: Users can only submit, not edit wetland data

#### 2.3 Approval Workflow Tests
- [ ] **User approval gate**: New users cannot access system until approved (if implemented)
- [ ] **Restricted access**: Unapproved users cannot submit observations or view wetland data
- [ ] **Notification system**: Test approval notifications and status updates

### 3. Security & Usability

#### 3.1 Password & Security Tests
- [ ] **Password hashing**: Verify no plain text password storage
- [ ] **Password reset**: Test reset functionality
- [ ] **RBAC enforcement**: Verify role-based access control prevents privilege escalation
- [ ] **Token security**: Test JWT token validation and expiration

#### 3.2 Audit & Logs Tests
- [ ] **Admin action logging**: User deletions, wetland edits are logged
- [ ] **Observation logging**: Observation submissions are logged
- [ ] **Audit trail**: Test log integrity and accessibility

#### 3.3 Data Integrity Tests
- [ ] **Referential integrity**: Wetlands cannot be deleted if linked to observations without warning
- [ ] **Input validation**: Test email formats, strong passwords, SQL injection prevention
- [ ] **Data consistency**: Test database constraints and validation rules

### 4. Scalability & Reliability

#### 4.1 Performance Tests
- [ ] **Multiple wetlands**: Test dashboard performance with large datasets
- [ ] **Concurrent users**: Test multiple simultaneous logins and operations
- [ ] **Data loading**: Test performance with many observations

#### 4.2 Reliability Tests
- [ ] **Error handling**: Test graceful error handling and user feedback
- [ ] **Network issues**: Test offline/online behavior
- [ ] **Data persistence**: Test data integrity across sessions

## Test Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- RegisterForm properly excludes admin role from public signup

### üîÑ In Progress
- Creating comprehensive test scenarios and implementations

### ‚ùå Needs Implementation
- User approval workflow (currently users are active by default)
- Advanced audit logging system
- Password reset email functionality
- Referential integrity warnings for wetland deletion

## Critical Findings

### 1. Missing User Approval Workflow
**Current State**: Users are automatically active upon registration
**Required**: Users should require admin approval before accessing the system
**Priority**: HIGH

### 2. Missing Advanced Audit Logging
**Current State**: Basic operation logging exists
**Required**: Comprehensive audit trail with user actions, timestamps, and change history
**Priority**: MEDIUM

### 3. Password Security
**Current State**: Password hashing implemented with bcrypt
**Status**: ‚úÖ SECURE

### 4. Role-Based Access Control
**Current State**: Comprehensive RBAC system implemented
**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

## Next Steps
1. Implement user approval workflow
2. Create automated test suites
3. Add advanced audit logging
4. Implement referential integrity warnings
5. Create performance benchmarks
