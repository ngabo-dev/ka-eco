# Ka-Eco Wetland Management System - Manual Testing Guide

## üéØ Critical Finding: User Approval Workflow Missing

**ISSUE**: Users are currently automatically active upon registration, but requirements specify that admin approval should be required.

**SOLUTION NEEDED**: Implement a pending approval status for new users.

## üß™ Manual Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Account Creation & Role Restrictions

#### Test Steps:
1. **Navigate to Registration**:
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Click "Sign Up" or register link
   
2. **Verify Role Options**:
   - ‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Only "Researcher", "Government Official", "Community Member" visible
   - ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: Admin role is NOT available in dropdown
   
3. **Create Test Users**:
   ```bash
   # Create different role users for testing
   User 1: researcher_test / researcher@test.com / password123 / researcher
   User 2: gov_test / gov@test.com / password123 / government_official  
   User 3: community_test / community@test.com / password123 / community_member
   ```
   
4. **Verify Registration Success**:
   - ‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Success message and redirect to login
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **ISSUE**: Users are immediately active (should require approval)

### Scenario 2: Login & Role-Based Dashboard Access

#### Test Steps:
1. **Admin Login**:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`
   - ‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Access to Admin Dashboard with user management
   
2. **Test Each Role Login**:
   - Log in with each created test user
   - ‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Each role sees appropriate dashboard sections
   
3. **Verify Dashboard Adaptations**:
   - Admin: User Management, System Management, All sections
   - Researcher: Research tools, data submission, limited admin features
   - Government Official: Policy tools, reporting, oversight features
   - Community Member: Basic observation tools, community features

### Scenario 3: Admin User Management

#### Test Steps:
1. **Access User List**:
   - Login as admin
   - Navigate to User Management tab
   - ‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: See all registered users
   
2. **User Operations**:
   - ‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Admin can view user details
   - ‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Admin can edit user information
   - ‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Admin can delete users (with confirmation)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **MISSING**: User approval/rejection workflow
   
3. **Permission Verification**:
   - Logout and login as non-admin user
   - ‚ùå **EXPECTED**: No access to user management features

### Scenario 4: Wetland Management Permissions

#### Test Steps:
1. **Admin Wetland Operations**:
   - Login as admin
   - Navigate to Wetland Management
   - ‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Can add, edit, delete wetland records
   - ‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Access to all wetland attributes (name, location, size, biodiversity, status)
   
2. **Non-Admin Wetland Access**:
   - Login as researcher/other roles
   - Navigate to Wetland section
   - ‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Can view wetland data
   - ‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Can submit observations
   - ‚ùå **EXPECTED**: Cannot modify wetland records

### Scenario 5: Observation Submission Workflow

#### Test Steps:
1. **Submit Observation** (as non-admin user):
   - Login as researcher
   - Navigate to wetland observation form
   - Submit observation with:
     - Wetland selection
     - Species sighting data
     - Water quality measurements
     - Pollution incidents (if any)
     - Photos/notes
   
2. **Admin Review**:
   - Login as admin
   - ‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: See submitted observations in dashboard
   - ‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Observations show timestamp and submitter
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **MISSING**: Formal approval/review workflow for observations

### Scenario 6: Security & Access Control

#### Test Steps:
1. **Password Security**:
   - ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: Passwords are hashed (bcrypt)
   - ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: No plain text storage
   
2. **Session Management**:
   - ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: 30-minute session timeout implemented
   - ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: Activity-based session renewal
   
3. **Token Security**:
   - ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: JWT tokens with proper expiration
   - ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: Secure token validation
   
4. **Role Escalation Prevention**:
   - Try accessing admin endpoints as non-admin user
   - ‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Access denied with proper error messages

### Scenario 7: Data Integrity & Validation

#### Test Steps:
1. **Input Validation**:
   - Test invalid email formats
   - Test weak passwords
   - Test required field validation
   - ‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Proper error messages and validation
   
2. **Referential Integrity**:
   - Try deleting wetland with associated observations
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS TESTING**: Should show warning or prevent deletion
   
3. **SQL Injection Protection**:
   - Test with malicious input in forms
   - ‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Input sanitization prevents injection

## üö® Critical Issues Identified

### 1. User Approval Workflow (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Current State**: Users are automatically active upon registration
**Required State**: Users should require admin approval before system access
**Impact**: Violates security requirements

**Implementation Needed**:
```sql
-- Add approval fields to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN approval_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending';
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN approved_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN approved_at TIMESTAMP;
```

### 2. Observation Review Workflow (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Current State**: Observations are immediately visible
**Suggested Improvement**: Admin review and approval process
**Impact**: Data quality control

### 3. Enhanced Audit Logging (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Current State**: Basic logging exists
**Suggested Improvement**: Comprehensive audit trail with:
- User actions (login, logout, data changes)
- Admin actions (user management, wetland changes)
- Timestamps and IP tracking
- Change history for critical data

## ‚úÖ Strengths Identified

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Comprehensive RBAC system implemented
2. **Password Security**: Proper hashing with bcrypt
3. **Session Management**: Timeout and activity tracking
4. **Component Architecture**: Well-structured, maintainable code
5. **Input Validation**: Good client and server-side validation
6. **Responsive Design**: Adaptive UI for different screen sizes

## üîß Immediate Action Items

### High Priority (Implement Now)
1. **Add User Approval Workflow**:
   - Modify user registration to set `is_active = False` by default
   - Add admin interface for user approval
   - Add email notifications for approval status

2. **Enhance Referential Integrity**:
   - Add cascade/restrict options for wetland deletion
   - Implement warning dialogs for data deletion with relationships

### Medium Priority (Next Sprint)
3. **Advanced Audit Logging**:
   - Implement activity logging table
   - Add audit trail for all CRUD operations
   - Create admin audit view

4. **Password Reset Functionality**:
   - Implement email-based password reset
   - Add secure token generation and validation

### Low Priority (Future Enhancements)
5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Add database indexing
   - Implement pagination for large datasets
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data

6. **Enhanced Reporting**:
   - Add data export functionality
   - Implement scheduled reports
   - Add data visualization tools
